#
# This dirscript is primarily for mp3 sites. It allows the siteop to
#   prevent certain types of releases from ever being uploaded by not
#   allowing the user to create the directory in the first place. It
#   is very powerful, allowing restrictions by rls date, rls group,
#   name format, and can disallow live rels, rels already in the dupe
#   log, and rels already existing in your site's PRE directories (to
#   prevent racing of PREs. Add it to glftpd.conf as pre_dir_check.
#
# Changes 1.4.1 -> 1.5.1:
#   * BANNEDALSO now shows what was banned
#
# Changes 1.4.1 -> 1.5:
#   * made DIR_CHECK, PRE_DIRS, BANNED and DAYSBACK optional
#   * dont log the same msg more than once (needs $LOGFILE.tmp)
#   * deny trading affil pre's (DENY_PRETRADE)
#   * made ALLOWED_YEARS a bit more "dynamic" (ALLOWED_DYN_YEARS)
#   * deny dupe releasedirs in yesterdays dir (CHECK_DUPE_YDAY)
#   * deny previously NUKED releases in today/yesterdays dir
#   * renamed script to dirscript.sh
#
# Changes 1.4 -> 1.4.1:
#   * "sample" dirs are no longer checked against the dupe DB (like cd[1-9]).
#
# Explanation of configuration options:
# -------------------------------------
# NOCHECK_TREES - Don't process new dirs under these directory hier-
#	archies. Multiple hierarchies should be space delimited.
# DAYSBACK - Number of days back to check with regular dupechecking.
#	If ANALDUPECHECK=1, set this low, as it's quite slow.
# BANNED - Names of groups whose releases aren't allowed (space delim).
# ANALDUPECHECK - 1/0 Check thru entire SITE DUPE db to make sure the dir
#	being created is DEFINITELY not a dupe. Very fast.
# DATAPATH - glftpd's datapath, as listed in glftpd.conf
# ALLOWPARENS - Allow dirnames to start with "("
# RIAA_UNDERSCORES - Tries to disallow Names.Like--This.Name-FOO as
#	the RIAA specs say that Names_Must-Be_Like-THIS
# RIAA_NAMELENGTH - Enforces the RIAA 64-char max dirname length
# ALLOWED_YEARS - Disallows directories not containing the 4-digit year 
#	number or one of several permutations of the last 2 digits and
#	punctuation (e.g. *-99*, *.99*, *99.*, *99-*, *99####*, *####99*,
#	etc.) It is very intelligent. I suggest you try it out. Multiple
#	allowed years should be space delimited.
# AFFILS - Space delimited list of groups allowed to break the banned years
#	rules. For this to work, the new dir's name must end in "-GRP", 
#	where GRP is the group you have specified here.
# LOGFILE - Logs the denied MKDIR requests, and lists the reason and
#	user who tried to create the directory. Make sure the file is
#	world writable (chmod 666) so this can work.
#	Sames goes for $LOGFILE.tmp (needed to prevent spamming log)
# LIVE_OK - 1/0 Whether to allow Live releases from non-affils
# PRE_DIRS - If a rls is already here, its creation will be prevented.
# ALLOWED_DYN_YEARS - Instead of "fixed" years you also use "dynamic" years.
#	Set it to "-3 1" to allow releases from 3y in the past to 1y in the
#	future. If this is set it replaces ALLOWED_YEARS. Don't need to
#	update a variable anymore every few years :) 
# BANNEDALSO - For banning on strings like BOOTLEG, -SRC- and -CC- etc
# DATE_FORMAT - Date format for daydirs e.g. 1231 is "%m%d"
# CHECK_DIR - 1/0 Disabled by default since it is kinda useless, but its
#	there if you want it
# SITE_DIR - Set to mp3 section e.g. /site/mp3, used for denying dupes
#	in yesterdays daydir 
# CHECK_PRE_DIRS - 1/0 Enable PRE_DIRS check. Default is disabled
# CHECK_DUPE_YDAY - 1/0 Deny dupe releasedirs in yesterdays dir
# CHECK_NUKED - 1/0 Deny previously NUKED releases
# CHECK_NUKED_YDAY - 1/0 Deny previously NUKED releases in yesterdays dir
# CHECK_BANNED_GROUPS - 1/0 Deny releases by BANNED groups
# CHECK_BANNED_ALSO - 1/0 Deny release dirs matching BANNEDALSO
# DENY_PRETRADE - 1/0 Deny mkdir for AFFILS releases (allows latepre)
# AFFILS_LATEPRE - Use these affils for DENY_PRETRADE instead of all AFFILS
